        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Oct 2016 - Present</h3>
        <p>
          <i itemprop="jobTitle">Core Engine Team Lead</i>,
          <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://cloudnc.com/">CloudNC</a>, London, UK.<br/>
          My team is developing autonomous "one-click" toolpath planning and optimization for CNC metal milling machines.
        </p>

        <h3>Jan 2016 - Oct 2016 (10 months)</h3>
        <p>
          <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D software engineer</i>,
          <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/">Autodesk Research</a>, London, UK.<br/>
          I worked at Autodesk Research London, in the <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/dreamcatcher">Project Dreamcatcher</a> team.
          Dreamcatcher is a <a href="https://lineshapespace.com/generative-design/">Generative Design</a> CAD tool for topology optimization, design space exploration
          and <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/within/overview">lattice infill</a>, which takes advantage of additive manufacturing (3D printing) to produce lighter products
          while still meeting design constraints and objectives.
        </p>

        <h3>Feb 2015 - Jan 2016 (1 year)</h3>
        <p>
          <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D software engineer</i>,
          <a itemprop="worksFor" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/professional/">Bloomberg LP</a>, London, UK.<br/>
          I worked in the Shared Services (middleware) team. We built an asynchronous, multi-threaded, cloud-based API that consolidated access to financial data across different sources and interfacing with multiple teams.
          I was Scrum master and played a major role in my team's adoption of Agile, as well as streamlining development with task prioritization, testing, continuous integration, build and version control.
        </p>

        <h3>Sep 2011 - Jan 2015 (3 years 5 months)</h3>
        <p>
          <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D engineer</i>,
          <a href="http://www.synopsys.com">Synopsys</a>, Dublin, Ireland.<br/>
          I worked on <a href="http://www.synopsys.com/Tools/Implementation/SignOff/Pages/PrimeTime.aspx">PrimeTime</a>, an electronic-circuit static-timing analysis tool that calculates worst-case signal propagation delays and checks timing constraints. PrimeTime is used by semiconductor companies such as Intel, Samsung, AMD and nVidia, to ensure integrity of their designs before signoff for manufacture.<br/>
          My team was focused on improving the performance and capacity of the tool, keeping it well ahead of Moore’s law — and of our competitors. As a Senior R&D Engineer, I was tasked with constantly searching for opportunities for performance improvements through profiling and similar techniques. I had an extensive exposure to PrimeTime's very large C++ code-base and as a result I directly proposed and followed multiple projects from idea to completion. These projects included multi-threading, low-level optimisations to our memory allocators, deployment of inlining and algorithmic enhancements to various areas.<br/>
          My most significant projects were: optimizing the netlist in-memory representation, redesigning and rewriting a multi-threaded collection search and matching engine, and adding a parallel foreach (interprocess map-reduce) built-in command to a Tcl interpreter.<br/>
          I had a central role as a reference in C++ within the team. During our product-wide migration from C to C++, I was trusted as a local contact in the refreshing of our coding guidelines. I gave talks on C++ topics to the rest of the team. I also took part in interviews and ramp-up of new hires.<br/>

          <a href="http://www.st.com">STMicroelectronics</a>, Grenoble, France.<br/>
          I worked on transactional-level modelling, a technique for
          early architecture exploration and simulation of embedded systems.
          I wrote and analysed complex multi-threaded code in C++ and Java.
          I directly supervised three Master-level students during their
          6-month, last-year projects.
